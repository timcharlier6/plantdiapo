# PLANTS

Plants are the source of all oxygen, and all the carbon in the world.

We can't live without plants, they produce everything we breath, everything we eat.

The clothes I wear, the chairs we sit on, the fuel we burn in our cars, the drugs we take, everything is based by plants.

Plants are factories that produce chemicals for us.

For example Vitamin C, we can't produce it.

But plants do, and that's why we drink orange juice.

Vitamin A, carotene, caffeine.

How many of you had coffee this morning?

Tea?

We really enjoy our caffeine.

We can't make it.

The plants take light and in their leaves, they make these chemicals that we all use.

Morphine, as pain killers.

THC, which for marijuana.

Potato, yams, poppy, the mulberry tree, cotton, or the rubber tree.

So take a second, think about these plants and which one do you think has most affected human history.

So wheat, why wheat?

Well, then thousand years ago, somewhere in the fertile crescent, Mesopotamia, from Iraq, up through Turkey, Syria, down in through present day Israel.

Some nomadic gatherer, hunter, had the warewithol.

To gather some of the wild wheat that was growing there on the fertile crescent, to save the seeds and to plant that the next year.

This was the first crop that was ever cultivated, and it was actually the cultivation of wheat allowed for all of modern history because the cultivation of wheat allowed for people to plan for their food.

It allowed for the first communities, it allowed for written history and everything that all of modern history that preceded from it was because of the cultivation of wheat.

Later in life, later in history also rice was cultivated, corn was cultivated other animals were cultivated other plants but wheat was the first plant that was cultivated to allow modern agriculture.

The mulberry bush, what's the importance of the mulberry bush?

Well, the mulberry bush actually is the only food of the silkworm.

And the importance of the silkworm in history was, of course, the route to the East, that Marco Polo found the east.

And the trade with the East opened up the whole world connecting West and East.

How about the opium poppy?

Well, I guess you can understand how the opium poppy affected history.

One, it allowed for the first analgesics, painkillers, which has affected all of modern medicine.

But it also affects modern history with the drug problem.

So ,of course here we see one plant making one chemical affecting both good things and bad things in human history.

How about the potato?

How is that affected history?

The potato affected history because of the Irish potato famine.

In the 19th century, there was only strain of potato growing in all of Ireland.

Unfortunately though, this strain was sensitive to a fungal like pathogen called phytothora.

And this pathogen wiped out potato yields for several years.

This led to the huge famine which led to death of a million people and to the immigration of another million people to other countries in Europe and to North America.

How about cotton?

How has that affected modern history?

Well of course modern cotton has affected us by what we wear.

If you like wearing blue jeans, if you like wearing nice T-shirts.

Cotton actually though, the need for cotton, was one of the emphasis for the importing of slaves from Africa to the New World to North America.

The rubber tree, how's the rubber tree affected it?

Well, if any of you have ever gone on an airplane, if you've flown anywhere, you're dependant on the rubber tree.

Because the rubber that comes from the rubber tree, natural, natural rubber is the only material that airplane wheels can be made of.

There is no synthetic rubber, there's no synthetic type of plastic that can match the characteristics of natural rubber.

So, without rubber we would have no air flight.

Last one, yams, I'm not talking here about sweet potatoes, I'm talking about yams.

How have yams actually affected our history.

I think you'll probably be surprised to know, that yams led to the development of the modern birth control pill.

Because yams contain a phytoestrogen.

And it was from yams that they first isolated this estrogen that was the source of the first birth control pills.

I think this has obviously affected many of our lives.

So, now that we've gone through all these again, take another second and refill out the survey, which of these plants do you think has affected your life the best?

So, I think you could see that really our entire life is affected by plants.

Whether it's by the coffee we drink, I mean how many of you drink let's say two cups of coffee a day.

I know, I do.

You know, just for me in the world, there are 15 coffee trees that need to be grown to supply me with my two cups a day.

If you multiply that by all the coffee drinkers in the world, think how much coffee we need to grow in order to supply that need.

If there are any musicians among you, you know the wood that goes into a Stradivarius violin, or to a Martin guitar, completely affect what type of tone you get.

It's because of the characteristics of the wood that can't be matched by anything made of plastic or that's synthetic.

Or a natural wood basketball court, or Aspirin for example it comes from a plant product.

So, our entire life is really completely dependent on plants.
